An environment for you to work in has been prepared in advance.  Depending on your hack, you will either need access to an Azure subscription, an Azure DevOps organisation or both.

Please follow the steps below before starting your mini-hack.

1. Invent a team name.  You can use this for uniqueness when creating resources. If you do this, just use alphameric characters and dont use spaces.
2. Obtain your unique user name and password for your team by asking a proctor.
3. Logon to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).  In doing so you will be asked to change your password.
4. Logon to the [Azure DevOps Portal](https://dev.azure.com)
5. Any problems speak to a proctor

That's it! We hope you enjoy your mini-hack. Let's get started.
