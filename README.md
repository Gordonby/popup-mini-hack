# Welcome to Pop-up Mini-Hack!

Pop-up mini-hacks can be run on the spur of the moment when a customer or partner wnats to investigate a particular technology.  They require minimal resources, preparation or pre-requisites and enable dynamic teams to work together to learn about new colleagues and new technologies. The aim is that the hack can be completed in 2 hours.

Pop-up mini-hacks are challenge oriented, so that the hack teams can research and learn the technology for themselves, but have guidelines to avoid wasting too much time.  There are also more comprehensive instructions to enable the teams to catch-up or skip sections that arent useful.

The hacks themselves are graded as easy, medium and difficult and the challenges themselves get progressively harder within the hack so that there is some learning for everyone regardless of their pre-existing skills.

> This is an embryonic idea that we are trying to develop in a lean way, by accepting feedback and pivoting to obtain maximum usefulnesss.  Please bear with us if we encounter teething problems :-)
