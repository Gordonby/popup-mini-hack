The aim of this challenge is to create a fully deployed sample application that is accessible from the internet, together with an Azure Repo containing your source code and a CI/CD pipeline using Azure Pipelines.

If you plan to use the cheat-sheets then chose to build your application using .NET Core and deploy it in WebApps for containers.

> Done: You can browse to the Application Home Page. 

## Challenge #2 - Change the sample application home page
The aim of this challenge is to make a simple change to the Sample Application Home Page.  You must include the text "Mini-hack<your team name>" somewhere on the hope page of your application. 

> Done: You must be able to browse to your application and see the change.

## Challenge #3 - Use the Azure Portal to browse to the container you just deployed.
The aim of this challenge is to take a inspect the properties of the container that you just deployed in challenge 2. 

> Done: Take a screen-shot of the properties

## Challenge #4 - Automatically create a work item when the build fails
The aim of this challenge is to configure Azure DevOps to automatically log a bug if your build fails.  You will need to aemd your code or some one of the unit tests to force the build to fail.
